# Zenflow Task Structure Specification

## Overview

This specification defines how tasks and stories are organized within the Zenflow workflow to maximize Agile delivery while maintaining clear artifact management. The structure organizes work by **type** rather than **temporal sequence**, enabling flexible, iterative development while supporting the seven Zenflow stages.

For the technical implementation details, APIs, and component architecture that manages this task structure, see the [Work Management Technical Specification](work-management.md).

## Core Principles

### Agile-First Design

- Lightweight documentation that supports working software
- Flexible artifact creation based on value and necessity
- Cross-stage work types that don't constrain iteration
- Just-in-time elaboration of details


### Zenflow Integration

- Clear progression through Align → Discover → Prioritize → Design → Build → Ship → Learn
- Stage-agnostic artifact types that can be created when needed
- Quality gates based on outcomes, not documentation completeness
- Machine-readable workflow state tracking

## Task Structure

Each task is organized in a logical work-type hierarchy:

```sh
.zen/work/tasks/PROJ-123/
├─ .zenflow/                  # Zenflow state and progression tracking
├─ index.md                   # Story brief (required)
├─ manifest.yaml              # Machine-readable metadata
├─ .taskrc.yaml              # Task-specific configuration
├─ research/                  # Investigation and discovery work
├─ spikes/                    # Technical exploration and prototyping  
├─ design/                    # Specifications and planning artifacts
├─ execution/                 # Implementation evidence and results
├─ outcomes/                  # Learning, metrics, and retrospectives
└─ metadata/                  # External system snapshots
```

## Work Type Definitions


### Task/Story Brief (index.md)
The foundational document that remains lightweight and user-focused throughout the task lifecycle. Contains user story, acceptance criteria, success metrics, and scope boundaries. Required for all tasks.

### Machine-readable Metadata (manifest.yaml)
Rich YAML file containing detailed workflow progression, quality gates, integrations, and automation metadata. Drives workflow automation and external system synchronization. Required for all tasks.

### Task Configuration (.taskrc.yaml)
Task-specific configuration controlling automation behavior, quality standards, team settings, and integration preferences. Required for all tasks.

### Research Directory
Contains all investigative work including user research, requirements gathering, competitive analysis, and assumption validation. Created during Discover stage but can be updated throughout the task lifecycle as new insights emerge.

### Spikes Directory
Houses technical exploration, proof-of-concepts, feasibility studies, and prototyping work. Can be created at any Zenflow stage when technical uncertainty needs resolution. Emphasizes learning over perfect documentation.

### Design Directory  
Holds technical specifications, architecture decisions (ADRs), API contracts, and implementation planning. Created primarily during Design stage but can evolve during Build as implementation details emerge.

### Execution Directory
Contains implementation evidence including code reviews, test results, deployment logs, and monitoring setup. Populated during Build and Ship stages to provide audit trail of delivery quality.

### Outcomes Directory
Captures success measurements, user feedback, retrospectives, and learnings for future iterations. Primarily populated during Learn stage but can be updated throughout as insights emerge.

### Metadata Directory
Contains raw snapshots from external systems (Jira, GitHub, Figma, Confluence) for integration and synchronization purposes. Automatically managed by external sync processes.

## Zenflow Stage Mapping

The work types support all seven Zenflow stages without constraining when artifacts are created:

| Stage | Align | Discover | Prioritize | Design | Build | Ship | Learn |
|-------|-------|----------|------------|--------|-------|------|-------|
| **Goal** | Define success criteria and stakeholder alignment | Gather evidence and validate assumptions | Rank work by value vs effort | Specify implementation approach | Deliver working software increment | Deploy safely to production | Measure outcomes and iterate |
| **Inputs** | Business requirements, stakeholder needs | **Story brief**, user hypotheses | **Research findings**, spike results | **Priority decisions**, technical constraints | **Technical specifications**, implementation plan | **Working software**, deployment strategy | **Production deployment**, success criteria |
| **Key Activities** | Story definition, success metrics, stakeholder alignment | User research, requirements gathering, feasibility validation | WSJF/RICE scoring, value analysis, effort estimation | Technical planning, architecture decisions, contract definition | Code development, testing, peer review | Deployment execution, monitoring setup, rollback preparation | Metrics collection, user feedback, retrospective analysis |
| **Required Outputs** | **index.md** (story brief) |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Primary Outputs** | | user-interviews, requirements | manifest.yaml (priority rationale) | technical-spec, adrs | code-reviews, test-results | deployment-logs, monitoring | metrics, retrospective |
| **Supporting Outputs** | assumptions, initial-exploration | feasibility-study, competitive-analysis | effort-estimates | architecture-exploration, api-contracts | implementation-poc, performance-tests | rollback-plan, deployment-validation | user-feedback, next-iteration |

## Quality Gates

Quality progression focuses on working software and user outcomes rather than documentation completeness:

### Stage Progression Criteria

- Align: Story brief complete with measurable success criteria
- Discover: Sufficient evidence to make informed design decisions
- Prioritize: Clear value proposition and effort understanding
- Design: Implementation approach agreed and technically feasible
- Build: Working software increment meets acceptance criteria
- Ship: Production deployment successful with monitoring active
- Learn: Success metrics captured and learnings documented


### Artifact Requirements

- Minimal viable documentation at each stage
- Optional artifacts created only when they add clear value
- Cross-stage flexibility allowing work type creation as needed
- Evidence-based progression rather than checklist completion

## Template Organization

Templates support just-in-time artifact creation:

```bash
.zen/work/tasks/_templates/
├─ .zenflow/                  # Zenflow state tracking templates
├─ index.md                   # Story brief template
├─ manifest.yaml              # Machine-readable metadata template
├─ .taskrc.yaml              # Task configuration template
├─ research/                  # Investigation templates
├─ spikes/                    # Exploration templates  
├─ design/                    # Specification templates
├─ execution/                 # Implementation templates
├─ outcomes/                  # Learning templates
└─ metadata/                  # External system integration templates
```

## Integration Points

### External Tool Synchronization

- Jira status mapping to Zenflow stages
- GitHub branch and PR integration with execution artifacts

### CLI Usage Examples

#### Task Management Commands
- `zen task create [TASK-ID] --type story/task` creates new task with full structure
- `zen task list` shows all tasks in workspace
- `zen task status [TASK-ID]` shows current stage and progress (current task if no ID)
- `zen task progress [TASK-ID]` advances to next Zenflow stage with validation
- `zen task config [TASK-ID]` manages task-specific settings

#### Content Creation Commands (Git-like)
- `zen write requirements` creates requirements document (auto-detects work type: research/)
