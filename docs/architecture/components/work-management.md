  - URL: N/A (local CLI)
  - Configuration: Local config files, mock external integrations
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing with ephemeral databases
  - URL: N/A (test runners)
  - Configuration: Test fixtures, mock services, isolated test databases
- **Production**: End-user CLI installations with real integrations
  - URL: N/A (local CLI)
  - Configuration: User workspace databases, real external system credentials

### Deployment Process
1. **Database Migration**: Initialize or upgrade task database schema
   - Automation: Automatic migration on first run, version compatibility checks
   - Validation: Schema validation, data integrity checks, rollback capability
2. **Component Integration**: Register Task Manager in Factory dependency chain
   - Automation: Factory pattern integration, service initialization
   - Validation: Dependency validation, service health checks
3. **External System Configuration**: Setup integrations and credential validation
   - Automation: Configuration validation, credential testing, connection verification
   - Validation: API connectivity, permission validation, sync capability

  - Default: false
  - Rollout: Gradual rollout with user configuration
- **quality-gates**: Enable quality gate validation for stage progression

## Migration Plan

No migration required for new installations. For existing Zen workspaces, migration will:
1. Create task database schema in `.zen/work/tasks.db`
2. Scan existing task directories and import metadata
3. Initialize workflow state based on existing artifacts
4. Preserve existing file structures and content

### Migration Steps
1. **Schema Creation**: Create SQLite database with task management schema
   - Duration: < 1 second
   - Risk: Low
   - Rollback: Delete database file
2. **Data Import**: Import existing task data from file system
   - Duration: Variable based on task count
   - Risk: Medium
   - Rollback: Restore from backup, disable Task Management
3. **Validation**: Verify imported data integrity and workflow states
   - Duration: < 30 seconds
   - Risk: Low
   - Rollback: Flag validation errors, continue with partial import
