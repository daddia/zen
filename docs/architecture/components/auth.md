```

The authentication component follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns. The interface layer defines a generic Manager interface that provides standardized authentication operations across all providers while maintaining strong error handling with specific error codes.

The implementation layer centers around token-based authentication with a persistent credential cache, utilizing multiple storage backends for maximum compatibility and security. All operations are designed to be thread-safe with proper concurrent access patterns and comprehensive error recovery mechanisms.

The storage layer provides pluggable storage strategies, including OS-native keychain storage for maximum security, encrypted file storage for environments without keychain access, and in-memory storage for testing scenarios. This design allows for platform-specific optimizations while maintaining consistent interfaces.

Finally, the integration layer enables seamless component integration through factory pattern dependency injection, providing error code translation between layers while maintaining interface compatibility with existing systems through adapter patterns.

## Key Features

The authentication component delivers centralized credential management through a unified interface that prevents authentication state fragmentation and ensures consistent security policies across all Git provider integrations throughout the Zen ecosystem.

Security capabilities include OS-native credential storage using platform keychains (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service), encrypted file storage with AES-256-GCM encryption for fallback scenarios, and comprehensive input validation with secure defaults for all authentication operations.

Provider extensibility encompasses support for GitHub and GitLab with provider-specific validation logic, pluggable architecture for adding new authentication providers, and configurable provider settings including custom API endpoints, required scopes, and environment variable mappings.

Storage flexibility provides multiple backend options with automatic fallback mechanisms, platform-specific optimizations for maximum security and compatibility, and configurable storage paths with proper permission management for secure credential persistence.

## Usage Patterns

The authentication component supports multiple usage patterns to accommodate different architectural needs within the Zen ecosystem. Factory-level integration enables commands to access authentication through the factory pattern, providing consistent configuration and setup across all components while ensuring easy access for all commands through a standardized interface.

Service-level integration allows services to use the authentication manager directly for complex authentication scenarios, supporting sophisticated credential management workflows where domain-specific logic requires direct authentication control and custom provider configurations.

Adapter integration preserves existing interfaces while leveraging the shared authentication infrastructure through well-defined adapter patterns. This approach ensures backward compatibility while enabling migration to the improved authentication system without breaking existing component integrations.
