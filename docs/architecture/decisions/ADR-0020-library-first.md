# ADR-0020 - Library-First Development Approach

## Context and Problem Statement

The Zen CLI platform requires rapid development velocity while maintaining high quality, security, and reliability standards. The team must decide whether to build custom implementations for common functionality or leverage existing battle-tested libraries from the Go ecosystem. This decision significantly impacts development speed, maintenance burden, security posture, and long-term technical debt. With Zen's ambitious roadmap and the need to focus engineering effort on differentiating AI-powered workflow capabilities, the approach to external dependencies becomes critical for success.

## Decision Drivers

* **Development Velocity**: Accelerate time-to-market by leveraging existing solutions rather than building from scratch
* **Quality & Reliability**: Utilize battle-tested libraries with proven track records in production environments
* **Security Posture**: Benefit from community security reviews and rapid vulnerability patching of popular libraries
* **Maintenance Burden**: Minimize long-term maintenance overhead by outsourcing common functionality to library maintainers
* **Focus on Differentiation**: Reserve engineering resources for building unique AI-powered productivity features that differentiate Zen
* **Community Standards**: Align with Go ecosystem best practices and familiar patterns for contributor onboarding

## Decision Outcome

Zen CLI will adopt a library-first development approach, prioritizing battle-tested libraries for common functionality and reserving custom implementation only for differentiating AI-powered workflow features. This approach maximizes development velocity and allows the team to focus engineering effort on Zen's unique value proposition while benefiting from community expertise, security reviews, and proven reliability.

### Consequences

**Good:**
- Rapid development velocity through proven, well-documented library solutions
- Reduced security risks by leveraging libraries with active security maintenance and community review
- Lower maintenance burden allowing focus on core AI and workflow differentiation features
- Improved code quality through adoption of community-vetted patterns and implementations
- Faster contributor onboarding with familiar library patterns and documentation

**Bad:**
- Increased binary size and potential dependency conflicts from external libraries
- Reduced control over implementation details and potential vendor lock-in scenarios
- Risk of library abandonment or breaking changes requiring migration effort
- Potential performance overhead from generic library solutions vs optimized custom code

### Confirmation

Regular dependency audits for security vulnerabilities, performance benchmarks comparing library vs custom implementations for critical paths, and quarterly reviews of library maintenance status and community health.
