# ADR-0005 - Structured Logging Implementation

## Context and Problem Statement

The Zen CLI requires a comprehensive logging system that supports debugging, monitoring, and operational visibility while maintaining performance and security. The logging system must handle various log levels, multiple output formats, and provide structured data for analysis while being developer-friendly and operationally robust.

Key requirements:
- Structured logging with consistent field naming and formatting
- Multiple log levels with runtime configuration
- Multiple output formats (human-readable text and machine-readable JSON)
- Performance optimization for high-throughput scenarios
- Security considerations for sensitive data handling
- Integration with CLI framework and configuration system
- Support for contextual logging with request/operation correlation
- Cross-platform compatibility and file output support

## Decision Drivers

* **Observability**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
* **Performance**: Minimal overhead in production environments
* **Structure**: Consistent, machine-readable log format for analysis
* **Security**: Safe handling of sensitive information in logs
* **Developer Experience**: Easy to use API with helpful debugging information
* **Operational Requirements**: Integration with log aggregation and monitoring systems
* **Flexibility**: Multiple output formats and destinations
* **Standards Compliance**: Industry-standard log levels and formats

## Considered Options

* **Logrus** - Popular structured logging library for Go
* **Zap** - High-performance logging library by Uber
* **Slog** - Go 1.21+ standard library structured logging
* **Go Log Package** - Standard library basic logging
* **Custom Implementation** - Build logging system from scratch

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Logrus v1.9.3+**, because it provides the optimal balance of features, maturity, and ease of use for CLI applications with excellent structured logging capabilities.

### Consequences

**Good:**
- Mature, battle-tested logging library with extensive ecosystem
- Excellent structured logging with JSON and text formatters
- Comprehensive log level support with runtime configuration
- Flexible hook system for extending functionality
- Easy integration with configuration management
- Good performance characteristics for CLI use cases
- Extensive documentation and community support
- Compatible with existing log aggregation systems

**Bad:**
- Additional dependency (~1MB to binary size)
- Not the highest performance option (acceptable for CLI use)
- Global logger state can complicate testing
- Some API design decisions are dated

**Neutral:**
- Different API patterns compared to newer alternatives
- Rich feature set may include unused functionality

### Confirmation

The decision has been validated through:
- Successful implementation with both text and JSON formatters
- Performance benchmarks showing acceptable overhead for CLI use
- Integration testing with configuration system
- Security review confirming no sensitive data leakage
- Developer feedback on API usability and debugging capabilities
- Compatibility testing with log aggregation systems

## Logging Architecture

### üìä **Log Levels**

| Level | Purpose | Usage | Examples |
|-------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Trace** | Detailed execution flow | Fine-grained debugging | Function entry/exit, variable values |
| **Debug** | Development debugging | Development and troubleshooting | Configuration loading, API calls |
| **Info** | General information | Normal operation events | Command execution, workflow progress |
| **Warn** | Warning conditions | Potentially problematic situations | Deprecated features, fallback behavior |
| **Error** | Error conditions | Error scenarios that don't stop execution | API failures, validation errors |
| **Fatal** | Fatal errors | Errors that cause application termination | Configuration failures, critical system errors |
| **Panic** | Panic conditions | Unrecoverable errors with stack trace | Programming errors, system failures |

### üèóÔ∏è **Output Formats**

#### **Text Format (Development)**
```
time="2025-09-12T12:34:56.789Z" level=info msg="workspace initialized" 
  directory="/path/to/workspace" config_file="/path/to/zen.yaml" 
  component=cli command=init
```

#### **JSON Format (Production)**
```json
{
  "time": "2025-09-12T12:34:56.789Z",
  "level": "info",
  "msg": "workspace initialized",
  "directory": "/path/to/workspace",
  "config_file": "/path/to/zen.yaml",
  "component": "cli",
  "command": "init"
}
```

### üéØ **Structured Fields**

**Standard Fields:**
- `time`: RFC3339 timestamp with millisecond precision
- `level`: Log level (trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, panic)
- `msg`: Human-readable message
- `component`: System component (cli, agent, workflow, integration)
- `command`: CLI command being executed
- `operation`: Specific operation within a command
- `duration`: Operation duration for performance tracking

**Contextual Fields:**
- `user_id`: User identifier (when available)
- `workspace`: Workspace path or identifier
- `correlation_id`: Request/operation correlation ID
- `version`: Application version
- `platform`: Operating system and architecture

### üîí **Security and Privacy**

**Sensitive Data Handling:**
- API keys and tokens are never logged
- User data is sanitized or redacted
- File paths are relative to workspace when possible
- Error messages exclude sensitive context
- Configurable field filtering for compliance

**Privacy Controls:**
```go
// Sensitive fields are automatically filtered
logger.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
    "api_key": "[REDACTED]",        // Automatically filtered
    "password": "[REDACTED]",       // Automatically filtered
    "file_path": "./relative/path", // Sanitized to relative path
}).Info("API request completed")
```

## Implementation Details

### üì¶ **Logger Interface**

```go
// Logger interface for structured logging
type Logger interface {
    Debug(msg string, fields ...interface{})
    Info(msg string, fields ...interface{})
    Warn(msg string, fields ...interface{})
    Error(msg string, fields ...interface{})
    Fatal(msg string, fields ...interface{})
    WithField(key string, value interface{}) Logger
    WithFields(fields map[string]interface{}) Logger
}

// Usage examples
logger.Info("command executed successfully", 
    "command", "init",
    "duration", "150ms",
    "workspace", "/path/to/workspace")

logger.WithFields(map[string]interface{}{
    "component": "agent",
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4",
}).Debug("API request initiated")
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Integration**

```yaml
# Configuration options
log_level: info          # trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, panic
log_format: text         # text, json
log_output: stdout       # stdout, stderr, file path
```

### üéõÔ∏è **Runtime Configuration**

```go
// Logger creation with configuration
func New(level, format string) Logger {
    logger := logrus.New()
    
    // Set log level
    logLevel, err := logrus.ParseLevel(level)
    if err != nil {
        logLevel = logrus.InfoLevel
    }
    logger.SetLevel(logLevel)
    
    // Set formatter
    switch format {
    case "json":
        logger.SetFormatter(&logrus.JSONFormatter{
            TimestampFormat: "2006-01-02T15:04:05.000Z07:00",
        })
    default:
        logger.SetFormatter(&logrus.TextFormatter{
            FullTimestamp:   true,
            TimestampFormat: "2006-01-02T15:04:05.000Z07:00",
        })
    }
    
    return &LogrusLogger{logger: logger}
}
```
