# ADR-0021 - Cobra CLI Framework Maximization

## Context

The Zen CLI platform is built on the [Cobra CLI framework](https://cobra.dev/), which powers critical infrastructure tools like Kubernetes kubectl, Docker CLI, and GitHub CLI.

Cobra provides extensive enterprise-grade features including sophisticated command orchestration, POSIX-compliant flag parsing, automatic help generation, shell completion, and modern integration capabilities.

The team must decide how extensively to leverage Cobra's advanced features versus building custom CLI functionality. This decision impacts developer productivity, user experience consistency, and long-term maintainability of the CLI interface.

## Decision Drivers

* **Developer Productivity**: Leverage Cobra's generator tools and automatic scaffolding to accelerate command development
* **User Experience Consistency**: Provide familiar, industry-standard CLI patterns that users expect from professional tools
* **Enterprise Readiness**: Utilize Cobra's battle-tested features for production deployment and enterprise integration requirements
* **Maintenance Efficiency**: Minimize custom CLI infrastructure code by maximizing framework-provided capabilities
* **Integration Standards**: Align with modern Go tooling practices including Viper configuration, OpenTelemetry tracing, and structured logging
* **Community Alignment**: Follow patterns established by successful CLI tools in the ecosystem

## Decision Outcome

Zen CLI will maximize utilization of [Cobra's enterprise-grade capabilities](https://cobra.dev/), including:

* **Intelligent Command Orchestration**: Sophisticated command tree architecture with unlimited nesting depth, persistent flag inheritance, and automatic command lifecycle management. 
* **POSIX-Compliant Flag Parsing**: Advanced validation, type safety, automatic type conversion, required flags, flag groups, and custom validators.  
* **Developer Experience Tools**: Cobra-cli generators, automatic help generation, shell completion (Bash, Zsh, Fish, PowerShell), man page generation, and markdown documentation.  
* **Modern Integration Capabilities**: Seamless Viper configuration management, context support, OpenTelemetry readiness, structured logging integration, and graceful shutdown.  

This approach leverages a battle-tested framework trusted by Kubernetes, Docker, GitHub CLI, and 173,000+ projects worldwide to deliver professional CLI experiences with minimal development effort.

### Consequences

**Good:**

- Accelerated command development through Cobra's generator tools and automatic scaffolding capabilities
- Professional user experience with automatic help generation, intelligent command suggestions, and comprehensive shell completion
- Enterprise-ready features including POSIX-compliant flag parsing, persistent flags, command aliases, and graceful shutdown
- Seamless integration with modern tooling including Viper configuration management and OpenTelemetry observability
- Reduced maintenance burden through framework-provided infrastructure and community support

**Bad:**

- Framework dependency constrains CLI architecture and implementation patterns
- Learning curve for advanced Cobra features and proper usage patterns across development team
- Potential overhead from unused framework features in simple command scenarios

### Confirmation

Code reviews ensuring proper utilization of Cobra patterns, user experience testing validating help system and command completion functionality, and performance benchmarks confirming framework overhead remains acceptable for CLI responsiveness requirements.
