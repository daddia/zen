# ADR-0014 - Quality Gates Framework

## Context and Problem Statement

The Zen CLI requires a comprehensive quality assurance framework to ensure code quality, security, performance, and reliability across the entire development lifecycle. The system must support automated quality checks, customizable quality standards, and integration with CI/CD pipelines while providing actionable feedback to developers.

Key requirements:
- Automated code quality analysis (linting, formatting, complexity)
- Security vulnerability scanning and dependency analysis
- Performance benchmarking and regression detection
- Test coverage tracking and quality metrics
- Plugin quality validation and certification
- Customizable quality standards for different environments
- Integration with development workflows and CI/CD systems
- Actionable quality reports and improvement suggestions

## Decision Drivers

* **Code Quality**: Maintain high standards for maintainability and readability
* **Security Assurance**: Prevent security vulnerabilities from reaching production
* **Performance Standards**: Ensure consistent performance across releases
* **Developer Experience**: Provide fast feedback and actionable improvement suggestions
* **Automation**: Minimize manual quality checks and human error
* **Consistency**: Standardize quality practices across all contributors
* **Extensibility**: Support custom quality rules and plugin validation
* **CI/CD Integration**: Seamless integration with automated deployment pipelines

## Considered Options

* **Comprehensive Quality Framework** - Multi-layered quality gates with extensive tooling
* **Essential Quality Tools** - Core linting, testing, and security scanning only
* **External Quality Service** - SaaS-based code quality and security analysis
* **Manual Quality Process** - Human-driven code reviews and quality checks
* **Minimal Quality Controls** - Basic formatting and compilation checks only

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Comprehensive Quality Framework**, because it provides the thorough quality assurance needed for enterprise adoption while supporting the plugin ecosystem and maintaining developer productivity through automation and fast feedback loops.

### Consequences

**Good:**
- Comprehensive quality assurance across all aspects of the codebase
- Early detection of quality issues before they reach production
- Consistent code quality standards across all contributors
- Automated quality enforcement reduces human error
- Detailed quality metrics support continuous improvement
- Plugin quality validation ensures ecosystem reliability
- Integration with CI/CD enables quality-gated deployments

**Bad:**
- Increased build time from comprehensive quality checks
- Initial setup complexity and configuration overhead
- Potential developer friction from strict quality enforcement
- Additional tooling dependencies and maintenance overhead
- False positive handling and quality rule tuning required

**Neutral:**
- Quality standards may need adjustment based on team feedback
- Balance required between quality enforcement and development velocity
- Ongoing maintenance needed for quality rule updates

### Confirmation

The decision will be validated through:
- Quality gate implementation showing <5 minute feedback time
- Developer satisfaction survey showing >80% positive response
- Quality metric improvements: test coverage >90%, security vulnerabilities <P2
- CI/CD integration with quality-gated deployments working reliably
- Plugin quality validation preventing low-quality plugins from distribution
- Performance benchmarks showing quality checks add <20% to build time
