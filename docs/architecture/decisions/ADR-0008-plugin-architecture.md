# ADR-0008 - Plugin Architecture Design

## Context and Problem Statement

The Zen CLI requires an extensible plugin system to support custom AI agents, external integrations, and template extensions without requiring changes to the core codebase. The system must balance security, performance, and developer experience while maintaining the single-binary distribution model and cross-platform compatibility.

Key requirements:
- Support for custom AI agents with different LLM providers
- External system integrations (JIRA, GitHub, Slack, etc.)
- Template extensions for workflow customization
- Secure plugin isolation and validation
- Hot-loading capability for development workflows
- Backward compatibility for plugin versioning
- Simple plugin development and distribution model

## Decision Drivers

* **Extensibility**: Enable third-party developers to extend Zen functionality
* **Security**: Prevent malicious plugins from compromising system security
* **Performance**: Minimal runtime overhead for plugin loading and execution
* **Developer Experience**: Simple plugin API and development workflow
* **Distribution**: Maintain single-binary distribution while supporting plugins
* **Cross-Platform**: Plugin system must work across Linux, macOS, and Windows
* **Isolation**: Plugins should not interfere with each other or core functionality
* **Versioning**: Support plugin compatibility and migration across Zen versions

## Considered Options

* **Go Plugin System** - Native Go plugin architecture with .so files
* **WebAssembly (WASM)** - Sandboxed execution with WASM runtime
* **External Process** - Plugins as separate executables with IPC
* **Embedded Lua** - Lua scripting engine for lightweight plugins
* **Configuration-Based** - YAML/JSON configuration for simple extensions

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **WebAssembly (WASM)** with fallback to **External Process** for complex integrations, because it provides the best combination of security, cross-platform compatibility, and performance while maintaining the single-binary distribution model.

### Consequences

**Good:**
- Strong security isolation through WASM sandbox
- Cross-platform compatibility without platform-specific binaries
- Excellent performance with near-native execution speed
- Language agnostic - plugins can be written in Rust, Go, C++, or AssemblyScript
- Single binary distribution maintained
- Hot-loading support for development workflows
- Deterministic execution environment

**Bad:**
- WASM runtime overhead (~2-5MB memory per plugin)
- Limited system API access requires careful interface design
- Learning curve for plugin developers unfamiliar with WASM
- Debugging complexity compared to native Go code
- Additional build toolchain requirements for plugin development

**Neutral:**
- Requires well-defined plugin API contracts
- Plugin size limitations due to WASM constraints
- Performance characteristics different from native plugins

### Confirmation

The decision will be validated through:
- Successful implementation of sample AI agent plugin in WASM
- Performance benchmarks showing <100ms plugin load time
- Security audit confirming sandbox isolation effectiveness
- Cross-platform testing on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Developer experience validation with external plugin developers
- Plugin API stability testing across Zen version updates

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Go Plugin System

**Good:**
- Native Go performance and debugging experience
- Direct access to Go standard library and ecosystem
- No additional runtime overhead
- Familiar development model for Go developers

**Bad:**
- Platform-specific .so files break single-binary distribution
- Limited cross-platform compatibility (especially Windows)
- Security concerns with direct memory access
- Plugin loading complexity and version compatibility issues
- No isolation between plugins and core system

**Neutral:**
- Requires careful API design to prevent breaking changes
- Plugin versioning complexity

### WebAssembly (WASM)

**Good:**
- Strong security isolation through sandboxing
- Cross-platform compatibility without platform-specific binaries
- Language agnostic plugin development
- Deterministic execution environment
- Hot-loading support
- Single binary distribution maintained
- Growing ecosystem and tooling support

**Bad:**
- Runtime overhead for WASM execution
- Limited system API access
- Additional complexity for plugin developers
- Debugging challenges compared to native code
- Memory usage overhead per plugin instance

**Neutral:**
- Requires well-defined host API for system interactions
- Performance characteristics different from native execution

### External Process

**Good:**
- Complete isolation between plugins and core system
- Language agnostic - any executable can be a plugin
- Easy debugging and development workflow
- No runtime overhead in core application
- Familiar development model

**Bad:**
- IPC communication overhead and complexity
- Process management complexity (spawning, monitoring, cleanup)
- Increased attack surface through IPC channels
- Distribution complexity with multiple binaries
- Platform-specific executable requirements

**Neutral:**
- Requires robust IPC protocol design
- Plugin lifecycle management complexity

### Embedded Lua

**Good:**
- Lightweight runtime with minimal overhead
- Simple scripting model for basic extensions
- Good performance for lightweight operations
- Easy to embed and distribute

**Bad:**
- Limited to Lua programming language
- Restricted functionality for complex integrations
- Security concerns with unrestricted script execution
- Limited ecosystem for AI and integration libraries
- Not suitable for performance-critical operations

**Neutral:**
- Good for configuration-driven extensions
- Simple but limited extensibility model

### Configuration-Based

**Good:**
- No runtime overhead or security concerns
- Simple YAML/JSON configuration model
- Easy to understand and maintain
- No plugin development complexity

**Bad:**
- Very limited extensibility - only predefined extension points
- No custom logic or complex integrations possible
- Not suitable for AI agent or advanced integration requirements
- Inflexible for future extensibility needs

**Neutral:**
- Suitable only for simple configuration-driven extensions
- May be used alongside other plugin systems

## More Information

**Plugin Architecture Components:**
- **Plugin Registry**: Discovery and management of installed plugins
- **WASM Runtime**: Wasmtime-based execution environment with resource limits
- **Host API**: Secure interface for plugin access to Zen functionality

- **Security Framework**: Capability-based permissions and resource limits

**Plugin Types:**
- **AI Agents**: Custom LLM providers and specialized AI workflows
- **Integrations**: External system connectors (JIRA, GitHub, Slack)
- **Templates**: Custom workflow and content generation templates
- **Quality Gates**: Custom validation and quality checking logic
