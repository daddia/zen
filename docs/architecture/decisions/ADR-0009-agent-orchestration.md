# ADR-0009 - AI Agent Orchestration

## Context and Problem Statement

The Zen CLI platform requires sophisticated AI agent orchestration to deliver context-aware automation across product and engineering workflows. The system must support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, local models), manage conversation contexts, optimize costs, and coordinate specialized agents for different domain tasks. The orchestration layer must be extensible to support future AI capabilities while maintaining high performance and reliability standards for production CLI usage.

## Decision Drivers

* **Multi-Provider Support**: Support for diverse LLM providers to avoid vendor lock-in and optimize for different use cases
* **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent token management, model selection, and usage monitoring to control operational costs  
* **Context Management**: Maintaining conversation history and workflow context across multi-turn interactions
* **Performance Requirements**: Agent response times < 2 seconds for interactive CLI usage, concurrent request handling
* **Extensibility**: Pluggable architecture for domain-specific agents and custom integrations
* **Reliability**: Robust error handling, rate limiting, and graceful degradation for production usage

## Considered Options

1. **Centralized Agent Manager with Provider Abstraction**
2. **Distributed Agent Registry with Event-Driven Orchestration**  
3. **Pipeline-Based Agent Composition**
4. **Simple Provider Wrapper with Basic Agent Interface**

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Centralized Agent Manager with Provider Abstraction", because it provides the optimal balance of simplicity, performance, and extensibility for CLI usage patterns. The centralized approach enables efficient resource management, cost tracking, and context coordination while the abstraction layer supports multiple providers and agent types.

### Consequences

**Good:**
- Unified interface for all AI interactions simplifies CLI command implementation
- Centralized cost tracking and token management enables budget controls and optimization
- Provider abstraction allows runtime model selection and failover capabilities
- Context management enables sophisticated multi-turn workflows and conversation continuity

**Bad:**
- Single point of failure for all AI operations requires robust error handling and circuit breakers
- Centralized architecture may become bottleneck for highly concurrent usage scenarios
- Complex provider abstraction layer increases implementation and maintenance overhead

### Confirmation

Architecture review with benchmarks demonstrating <2s response times for typical CLI operations, unit tests covering all provider implementations, and integration tests validating concurrent usage patterns and error recovery scenarios.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Centralized Agent Manager with Provider Abstraction

A single orchestration service that manages all AI agents through a unified interface while abstracting different LLM providers behind a common API.

**Good:**
- Single coordination point for all agent interactions and resource management
- Unified cost tracking, monitoring, and optimization across all providers and agents
- Simplified context management and conversation state persistence
- Clear separation of concerns between orchestration logic and provider implementations

**Neutral:**
- Moderate implementation complexity with well-defined interfaces

**Bad:**  
- Potential single point of failure requiring robust error handling
- Risk of performance bottleneck under high concurrent load

### Distributed Agent Registry with Event-Driven Orchestration

Multiple specialized agent services that coordinate through asynchronous events, with each agent type running independently and communicating via message passing.

**Good:**
- High scalability through distributed processing and event-driven coordination
- Natural fault isolation between different agent types and providers
- Flexible composition of agent workflows through event subscription patterns

**Bad:**
- Significant complexity in event coordination, ordering, and failure recovery
- Difficult to implement coherent cost tracking and resource management
- Complex debugging and troubleshooting of distributed workflows

### Pipeline-Based Agent Composition

A workflow engine that chains agents together in sequential pipelines, where each stage transforms data and passes results to the next agent in the chain.

**Good:**
- Natural composition of multi-stage workflows through pipeline abstraction
- Clear data flow and transformation semantics for complex processing chains
- Good testability through isolated pipeline stage testing

**Bad:**
- Rigid pipeline structure doesn't match conversational AI interaction patterns
- Complex configuration required for dynamic workflow routing and branching
- Poor fit for CLI's interactive, command-driven usage patterns

### Simple Provider Wrapper with Basic Agent Interface

Lightweight wrapper classes around each LLM provider with minimal abstraction, allowing direct access to provider-specific APIs.

**Good:**
- Minimal implementation complexity and fast time to market
- Direct mapping to provider APIs with minimal abstraction overhead
- Easy debugging and troubleshooting of provider interactions

**Bad:**
- No centralized cost management, context coordination, or resource optimization
- Difficult to extend with domain-specific agents and workflow orchestration
- Limited scalability for complex multi-agent scenarios and enterprise usage
