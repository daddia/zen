# ADR-0015 - Security Model Implementation

## Context and Problem Statement

The Zen CLI handles sensitive data including API keys, tokens, user credentials, and proprietary code/content across multiple external integrations. The security model must protect against common attack vectors while maintaining usability and supporting the plugin architecture, multi-source configuration system, and AI agent interactions.

Key requirements:
- Secure storage and handling of API keys and authentication tokens
- Input validation and sanitization across all user interfaces
- Audit logging for security-relevant events
- Plugin sandbox security and capability restrictions
- Secure communication with external services
- Protection against common CLI vulnerabilities (path traversal, injection attacks)
- Compliance with security frameworks (OWASP, SOC 2)
- Zero-trust architecture for external integrations

## Decision Drivers

* **Data Protection**: Secure handling of sensitive user and system data
* **Attack Surface Minimization**: Reduce exposure to common attack vectors
* **Compliance**: Meet security audit and regulatory requirements
* **Usability**: Security measures should not impede legitimate workflows
* **Plugin Security**: Isolate plugin execution and limit capabilities
* **Audit Requirements**: Comprehensive logging for security events
* **Zero Trust**: Assume compromise and verify all interactions
* **Performance**: Security measures should not significantly impact performance

## Considered Options

* **Comprehensive Security Framework** - Multi-layered security with encryption, validation, and monitoring
* **Basic Security Controls** - Essential security measures with minimal overhead
* **External Security Service** - Delegate security to third-party services
* **OS-Level Security** - Rely primarily on operating system security features
* **Minimal Security Model** - Basic input validation and secure defaults only

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Comprehensive Security Framework**, because it provides defense-in-depth protection suitable for enterprise environments while maintaining the flexibility needed for AI-powered workflows and plugin extensibility.

### Consequences

**Good:**
- Comprehensive protection against known attack vectors
- Enterprise-grade security suitable for sensitive environments
- Audit trail for compliance and incident response
- Plugin security isolation prevents malicious extensions
- Secure-by-default configuration reduces user error
- Extensible framework supports future security requirements
- Clear security boundaries and responsibilities

**Bad:**
- Increased complexity in implementation and maintenance
- Performance overhead from encryption and validation
- Additional dependencies for security libraries
- Learning curve for developers implementing security features
- Potential usability friction from security controls

**Neutral:**
- Requires ongoing security maintenance and updates
- Security controls may need adjustment based on usage patterns
- Balance needed between security and developer experience

### Confirmation

The decision will be validated through:
- Security audit by external firm confirming threat model coverage
- Penetration testing against common CLI attack vectors
- Plugin security testing with malicious plugin attempts
- Performance benchmarks showing <10% overhead from security controls
- Compliance assessment against SOC 2 and OWASP standards
- Developer security training and secure coding practices adoption

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Comprehensive Security Framework
