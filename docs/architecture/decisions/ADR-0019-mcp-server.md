# ADR-0019 - Model Context Protocol Server Integration

## Context and Problem Statement

The Zen CLI platform requires integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to enable AI agents to access external data sources, tools, and services in a standardized manner. MCP provides a protocol for LLMs to securely interact with external systems through server-side resources and tools, enabling more powerful and context-aware AI capabilities. The integration must support MCP server discovery, secure authentication, resource access, and tool execution while maintaining the CLI's performance and security requirements.

## Decision Drivers

* **AI Capability Enhancement**: Enable AI agents to access external data sources, databases, APIs, and tools through standardized MCP protocol
* **Security Requirements**: Secure authentication and authorization for MCP server access with proper credential management
* **Protocol Compliance**: Full compatibility with MCP specification for interoperability with existing MCP server ecosystem  
* **Performance**: Efficient resource access and tool execution with minimal impact on CLI response times
* **Extensibility**: Support for multiple MCP servers and easy addition of new server types and resources
* **Error Resilience**: Robust error handling for network failures, server unavailability, and authentication issues
* **Resource Management**: Efficient caching and connection pooling for MCP server interactions

## Considered Options

1. **Built-in MCP Client with Server Registry**
2. **Plugin-Based MCP Server Adapters**
3. **Proxy-Based MCP Gateway Service**
4. **Direct MCP Server Integration per Agent**

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Built-in MCP Client with Server Registry", because it provides optimal integration with the existing agent orchestration system while maintaining centralized management of MCP servers, authentication, and resource access. The built-in approach ensures consistent behavior and performance while the registry enables flexible server configuration.

### Consequences

**Good:**
- Centralized MCP server management enables consistent authentication, caching, and error handling
- Built-in client provides optimal performance with minimal overhead for CLI operations
- Server registry allows dynamic discovery and configuration of available MCP resources and tools
- Direct integration with agent system enables seamless context sharing and tool execution

**Bad:**
- Built-in implementation increases core system complexity and maintenance burden
- Less flexibility for custom MCP server protocols or non-standard implementations
- Potential for tight coupling between agent system and MCP client implementation

### Confirmation

Integration tests validating MCP protocol compliance, performance benchmarks showing <500ms resource access times, security audit of authentication and authorization flows, and compatibility tests with popular MCP server implementations.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Built-in MCP Client with Server Registry

A native MCP protocol client integrated directly into the Zen CLI core system, with a centralized registry for discovering and managing available MCP servers.

**Good:**
- Optimal performance with direct integration into agent orchestration system
- Centralized management of server configuration, authentication, and resource caching
- Consistent error handling and retry logic across all MCP server interactions
- Natural integration with existing CLI configuration and credential management systems

**Neutral:**
- Moderate implementation complexity requiring full MCP protocol support

**Bad:**
- Increases core system complexity with additional protocol implementation
- Less extensible for custom MCP server types or protocol extensions

### Plugin-Based MCP Server Adapters

A plugin architecture where each MCP server type is implemented as a separate plugin, allowing for custom server implementations and protocol variations.

**Good:**
- High extensibility enabling custom MCP server implementations and protocol extensions
- Clear separation of concerns between core system and MCP-specific functionality
- Independent development and testing of different MCP server types
- Natural integration with existing plugin architecture

**Bad:**
- Performance overhead from plugin abstraction and inter-process communication
- Complex plugin lifecycle management and configuration for MCP server discovery
- Difficult to implement consistent authentication and resource caching across plugins

### Proxy-Based MCP Gateway Service

A separate gateway service that sits between the CLI and MCP servers, handling protocol translation, load balancing, and resource aggregation.

**Good:**
- Clean separation between CLI and MCP server complexity through proxy abstraction
- Excellent scalability and caching capabilities for multiple concurrent CLI instances
- Centralized security enforcement and audit logging for all MCP interactions

**Bad:**
- Additional infrastructure complexity requiring proxy deployment and management
- Network latency overhead for all MCP operations impacting CLI responsiveness
- Over-engineered solution for single-user CLI scenarios

### Direct MCP Server Integration per Agent

Each AI agent implements its own MCP client functionality and connects directly to required MCP servers without shared infrastructure.

**Good:**
- Simple implementation with direct agent-to-server communication patterns
- Maximum flexibility for agent-specific MCP server selection and configuration
- Minimal abstraction overhead with direct protocol implementation per agent

**Bad:**
- Duplicate MCP client implementation across multiple agents increases maintenance burden
- No centralized resource management, authentication, or caching leading to inefficiencies
- Difficult to implement consistent security policies and audit logging across agents
