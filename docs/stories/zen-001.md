# Initialize Go Project Setup for Zen CLI Foundation

## 1. User Story
As a **developer on the Zen CLI team**, I want **a properly initialized Go project with Cobra CLI framework and complete project structure** so that **I can begin implementing CLI commands with consistent architecture, build processes, and dependency management**.

## 2. Context & Problem
The Zen CLI project needs a solid foundation to support the comprehensive AI-powered product lifecycle productivity platform. Without proper project setup, the team cannot begin development of the core CLI functionality that will serve both product managers and engineering teams.

**Current state:**
- No Go project structure exists
- No CLI framework is in place
- No build system or dependency management
- No development standards or tooling configured

**Why now:**
- ZEN-001 is the foundational story that enables all subsequent development
- Sprint 1 depends on having a working CLI foundation
- Team needs to establish development patterns and standards early

**Links:**
- [Zen CLI Structure Documentation](../cli-structure.md)
- [Implementation Roadmap](../roadmap.md)
- [Project Overview](../overview.md)

## 3. Business Value & Success Measures

**Value:** Enables development of AI-powered productivity platform that will reduce manual workflow time by 30%+ and context switching by 50%+

**Success metrics (MUST):**
- Go project builds successfully with `go build`
- CLI binary runs and displays help with `./zen --help`
- All core dependencies resolve without conflicts
- Project structure follows Go best practices
- Build time < 10 seconds for clean builds

**Guardrails (SHOULD):**
- No security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- All linting rules pass with zero warnings
- Code coverage infrastructure in place (target >80%)
- Documentation builds successfully

## 4. Scope

**In-scope (MUST):**
- Initialize Go module with proper naming convention
- Implement Cobra CLI framework integration
- Create complete project directory structure (cmd/, internal/, pkg/)
- Configure Makefile with essential build targets
- Setup .gitignore with Go-specific exclusions
- Configure go.mod with required dependencies
- Implement basic root command with help functionality
- Setup basic logging infrastructure
- Create initial CI/CD configuration files

**Out-of-scope (WON'T for this story):**
- Specific CLI command implementations (handled in subsequent stories)
- AI integration or external service connections
- Template system implementation
- Configuration management beyond basic setup
- Production deployment configurations
- Advanced testing frameworks (beyond basic setup)

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)

**Scenario: Successful project initialization and build**
- **Given** a clean development environment with Go 1.21+ installed
- **When** I clone the repository and run `make build`
- **Then** the build completes successfully without errors
  - **And** a `zen` binary is created in the `bin/` directory
  - **And** the binary size is reasonable (<50MB for initial version)

**Scenario: CLI help system displays correctly**
- **Given** the project has been built successfully
- **When** I run `./bin/zen --help`
- **Then** I see a professional help output with:
  - **And** the Zen CLI description and version
  - **And** available global flags (--help, --version, --verbose)
  - **And** placeholder command structure for future implementation
  - **And** proper formatting and alignment

**Scenario: Version command works correctly**
- **Given** the project has been built successfully
- **When** I run `./bin/zen --version` or `./bin/zen version`
- **Then** I see the current version number
  - **And** build information (commit hash, build time)
  - **And** Go version used for compilation

**Scenario: Invalid command handling**
- **Given** the CLI is running
- **When** I run `./bin/zen invalid-command`
- **Then** I see a helpful error message
  - **And** suggestions for valid commands
  - **And** the exit code is non-zero (1)

**Scenario: Project structure validation**
- **Given** the project has been initialized
- **When** I examine the directory structure
- **Then** I see the following directories exist:
  - **And** `cmd/zen/` contains the main CLI entry point
  - **And** `internal/` is ready for private packages
  - **And** `pkg/` is ready for public packages
  - **And** `docs/` contains project documentation
  - **And** `scripts/` contains build and utility scripts

**Scenario: Dependency resolution**
- **Given** the go.mod file is configured
- **When** I run `go mod download`
- **Then** all dependencies download without conflicts
  - **And** no security vulnerabilities are reported
  - **And** dependency versions are pinned appropriately

**Scenario: Cross-platform build capability**
- **Given** the project is properly configured
- **When** I run `make build-all`
- **Then** binaries are created for:
  - **And** Linux (amd64, arm64)
  - **And** macOS (amd64, arm64)
  - **And** Windows (amd64)
  - **And** all binaries execute their help command successfully

## 6. UX / Content

- **Designs:** N/A - CLI interface only

- **Content rules:** 
  - CLI help text uses professional, concise language
  - Error messages are helpful and actionable
  - Command descriptions use imperative voice
  - Consistent terminology with "Zen CLI" branding

- **Accessibility (MUST):** 
  - CLI output supports standard terminal accessibility tools
  - Color output respects NO_COLOR environment variable
  - Text output is screen reader compatible
  - Help text follows CLI accessibility best practices

## 7. Data, Telemetry & Events

- **Tracking plan (MUST):** 
  - No telemetry in initial version (privacy by default)
  - Build metrics tracked in CI/CD pipeline
  - Error logging to local files only

- **Data model impacts:** 
  - No persistent data storage in this story
  - Configuration will be file-based (zen.yaml)
  - No PII handling required

- **Experimentation (IF ANY):** 
  - No feature flags or experiments in foundation setup

## 8. API & Contract Changes

- **Endpoints touched/new:** N/A - CLI application only

- **Request/response diffs:** N/A - No external APIs in this story

- **Backward compatibility:** 
  - Initial version, no backward compatibility concerns
  - Semantic versioning will be used (starting at v0.1.0)

- **Contract tests (MUST):** 
  - CLI interface tests for help and version commands
  - Exit code validation tests
  - Output format validation tests

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements (Budgets)

| Area            | Requirement (MUST unless stated)                     |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Performance     | Build time < 10s; CLI startup < 100ms; help display < 50ms |
| Availability    | N/A for CLI tool; binary must be reliable           |
| Security        | No hardcoded secrets; secure dependency management; SAST scanning |
| Privacy         | No data collection; no external network calls       |
| Accessibility   | Terminal compatibility; NO_COLOR support; screen reader friendly |
| SEO             | N/A for CLI application                              |
| International   | UTF-8 support; English-first with i18n preparation  |

## 10. Operational Readiness
