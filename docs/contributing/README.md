## Contributing Philosophy

We believe in building a welcoming, inclusive community where everyone can contribute meaningfully to Zen's development.

### Core Principles

- **Quality First** - Every contribution improves the codebase
- **User Focus** - Changes should benefit end users
- **Simplicity** - Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- **Documentation** - Code without docs is incomplete
- **Testing** - Untested code is broken code
- **Collaboration** - Work together, learn together

## Ways to Contribute

### Code Contributions

### Non-Code Contributions
- Report bugs with clear reproduction steps

- Improve documentation and examples
- Review pull requests
- Help answer questions in discussions
