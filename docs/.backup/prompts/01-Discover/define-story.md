- **SHOULD** provide specific technical details for API contracts and data models
- **MAY** suggest implementation approaches based on architectural patterns
- **MUST NOT** leave placeholder text or generic content in any section
- **MUST NOT** skip sections even if minimal content - explain why if not applicable
</policies>

<quality_gates>
- User story follows standard format with clear persona, capability, and benefit
- Acceptance criteria are explicit, testable, and cover happy path, errors, and edge cases
- Success metrics include specific numeric targets and measurement methods
- NFR budgets specify concrete performance, availability, and security thresholds
- All dependencies and risks have mitigation strategies identified
- Test approach covers unit, integration, contract, and E2E testing
- Operational readiness includes observability, feature flags, and rollback plans
- Definition of Ready and Done checklists are complete and relevant
</quality_gates>

<workflow>
1) **Requirements Analysis**: Parse business requirements, user needs, and technical constraints
2) **Story Formulation**: Create user story with clear value proposition and success metrics
3) **Scope Definition**: Determine in-scope and out-of-scope items based on requirements
4) **Acceptance Criteria**: Write comprehensive Gherkin scenarios covering all paths
5) **Technical Specification**: Define API contracts, data models, and integration points
6) **NFR Definition**: Establish performance, security, and quality budgets
7) **Risk Assessment**: Identify risks, dependencies, and mitigation strategies
8) **Operational Planning**: Specify monitoring, rollout, and rollback procedures
9) **Validation**: Ensure all sections are complete with project-specific content

<output_contract>
Generate a complete story definition document in markdown format following the provided template structure:

## Required Output Format
```markdown
---
story_key: <JIRA-XXX>
epic: <JIRA-EPIC-X>
[... all metadata fields ...]
---

# [Story Title]

## 1) User Story
[Complete user story with persona, capability, and benefit]

## 2) Context & Problem
[Detailed problem statement with supporting context]

[... all 16 sections with complete, project-specific content ...]

## Definition of Ready (DoR)
[Checklist with all items marked appropriately]

## Definition of Done (DoD)
[Checklist with all items marked appropriately]
```

**MUST** populate all sections with relevant, specific content. **MUST** include concrete metrics, thresholds, and technical details. **MUST NOT** use placeholder text or skip sections.
</output_contract>

<gherkin_requirements>
## Acceptance Criteria Format
Each scenario **MUST** follow strict Gherkin syntax:

```gherkin
Scenario: [Descriptive scenario name]
  Given [initial context/state]
    And [additional context if needed]
  When [action/trigger]
    And [additional actions if needed]
  Then [expected outcome]
    And [additional outcomes if needed]
```

**MUST** include scenarios for:
- Happy path (primary success flow)
- Validation/error cases (at least 2)
- Edge cases (null, empty, boundary conditions)
- Accessibility flows (keyboard navigation, screen reader)
- Performance degradation (timeout, retry, circuit breaker)
</gherkin_requirements>

<nfr_specifications>
## Non-Functional Requirements Structure
**MUST** specify concrete, measurable values:

- **Performance**: Specific latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99) in milliseconds
- **Availability**: Uptime percentage with decimal precision (99.9%, 99.95%)
- **Security**: Specific OWASP controls, authentication methods, encryption standards
- **Scalability**: Requests per second, concurrent users, data volume limits
- **Accessibility**: WCAG level (2.2 AA/AAA), specific success criteria numbers
- **Observability**: Metric names, log levels, trace sampling rates
</nfr_specifications>

<risk_assessment>
## Risk Documentation Format
For each identified risk:

```markdown
**Risk**: [Specific risk description]
- **Probability**: High/Medium/Low
- **Impact**: High/Medium/Low  
- **Mitigation**: [Specific mitigation strategy]
- **Contingency**: [Fallback plan if mitigation fails]
- **Owner**: [Team/person responsible]
```
</risk_assessment>

<acceptance_criteria>
- Story definition is complete with all 16 sections populated
- User story clearly articulates value and benefit
- Acceptance criteria cover all user paths with Gherkin scenarios
- Technical specifications include API contracts and data models
- NFRs have specific, measurable targets
- Risks are identified with mitigation strategies
- Test approach covers all testing levels
- Operational readiness includes monitoring and rollback plans
- DoR and DoD checklists are complete and relevant
</acceptance_criteria>

<anti_patterns>
- Vague acceptance criteria without specific expected outcomes
- Missing error handling and edge case scenarios
- NFRs without concrete measurable thresholds
- Generic risk statements without mitigation plans
- Incomplete API contract specifications
- Missing operational considerations (monitoring, rollback)
- Placeholder text or "TBD" in critical sections
- Skipping sections without explanation
</anti_patterns>
