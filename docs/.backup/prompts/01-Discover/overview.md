</objective>

<policies>
- **MUST** follow the <output_contract> exactly.
- **MUST** provide 6-8 items for each feature/use case section.
- **SHOULD** focus on benefits over technical implementation details.
- **SHOULD** make quick start steps immediately actionable.
- **MAY** use TBD for unknown information.
- **MUST NOT** use marketing hype or emojis.
- **MUST** maintain professional, helpful tone.
</policies>

<quality_gates>
- Overview is 1-2 concrete sentences.

- Use cases describe real tasks or contexts.
- Quick start is runnable with minimal steps.
- All links resolve or marked as TBD.
- Consistent markdown formatting throughout.
</quality_gates>

<workflow>
1) **Parse Requirements**: Extract project name, tagline, and core value proposition.
2) **Synthesize Benefits**: Transform features into user-focused benefits.
3) **Identify Capabilities**: List technical strengths and differentiators.
4) **Define Use Cases**: Map to real-world scenarios and user needs.
5) **Simplify Onboarding**: Create minimal viable quick-start path.
6) **Structure Resources**: Organize documentation and contribution paths.
7) **Format Output**: Apply consistent markdown structure.
</workflow>
