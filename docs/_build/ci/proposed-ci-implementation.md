# Zen CLI CI/CD Pipeline Implementation Plan

## Phased Implementation Strategy for Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline

## Executive Summary

This implementation plan transforms the Zen CLI from its current solid CI/CD foundation into the comprehensive, production-ready pipeline outlined in the design document. The plan is structured in **6 phases** over **12-16 weeks**, ensuring minimal disruption to development velocity while systematically building towards a world-class CI/CD pipeline.

**Current State Assessment:**

- ✅ **Strong Foundation**: Comprehensive test pyramid with unit/integration/e2e/performance tests
- ✅ **Multi-Platform Builds**: Cross-platform compilation with GoReleaser integration
- ✅ **Basic Security**: gosec integration and SARIF reporting
- ✅ **Quality Gates**: Coverage reporting and lint integration
- ⚠️ **Enhancement Opportunities**: Local development tools, advanced security, distribution channels, monitoring

## Implementation Philosophy

1. **Velocity Preservation**: Each phase delivers value without disrupting active development
2. **Incremental Enhancement**: Build on existing strengths rather than replacing
3. **Developer Experience**: Prioritize tools that improve day-to-day development workflow
4. **Release Readiness**: Align timeline with product release milestones
5. **Automation First**: Minimize manual processes and maximize automated quality gates

- [ ] **Local development environment** configuration
- [ ] **Make target optimization** for development workflows
- [ ] **Documentation synchronization** automation

**Implementation Tasks:**

```bash
# Week 1: Pre-commit Hooks
.githooks/
├── pre-commit           # Format validation, basic tests
├── pre-push            # Full test suite, security scans
└── install.sh          # Hook installation script

# New Make targets
make dev-setup          # Install development tools
