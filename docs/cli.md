# Helix CLI: Comprehensive Analysis & Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Helix currently consists of **disparate resources** across 12 workflow stages, including 50+ AI prompts, Node.js tools, shell scripts, and templates. The opportunity is to create a **unified Go CLI** that orchestrates the entire agentic engineering workflow, integrating AI agents, external systems (Jira, Confluence, Git), and quality gates into a cohesive developer experience.

## Current State Analysis

### 🔍 **Existing Resources Inventory**

#### **1. AI Workflow Agents (12 Stages)**
- **01-Discover**: Discovery & overview generation agents
- **02-Prioritise**: WSJF/RICE/ICE prioritization framework
- **03-Design**: Technical design & contract specification
- **04-Architect**: Architecture review & ADR creation
- **05-Plan**: Planning & scaffolding generation
- **06-Build**: Code generation, refactoring, optimization
- **07-Code-Review**: Automated code review & quality analysis
- **08-QA**: Multi-layer testing orchestration
- **09-Security**: Security scanning & compliance validation
- **10-Release**: Progressive deployment & rollback management
- **11-Post-Deploy**: Production verification & monitoring
- **12-Roadmap-Feedback**: Analytics & continuous improvement

#### **2. Integration Tools (Node.js)**
- **Jira Integration**: Issue fetching, story creation, bulk operations
- **Confluence Publishing**: Markdown to Confluence with layout preservation
- **Cursor Helper**: AI-powered story generation via Cursor Agent CLI

#### **3. Automation Scripts (Bash)**
- **Story Workflow**: `cursor-generate-story.sh`, `write-story.sh`
- **Jira Operations**: `jira-fetch-issues.sh`, `jira-get-issue.sh`, `jira-update-story.sh`
- **Documentation**: `confluence-fetch.sh`, `confluence-publish.sh`

#### **4. Templates & Standards**
- **Story Definition**: Comprehensive 16-section template with DoR/DoD
- **Development Rules**: 130+ quality gates with CI/CD enforcement
- **Prompt Engineering**: XML-structured prompts with role/objective/policies

#### **5. Quality Gates & Enforcement**
- **Merge Blockers**: PR size (≤400 lines), coverage (≥70% baseline), security scans
- **Risk-Based Approval**: Low/Medium/High risk with different review requirements
- **Agent Integration**: Code review, testing, security, release validation

### 🎯 **Current Pain Points**

1. **Fragmented Toolchain**: Manual orchestration across scripts, tools, and systems
2. **Context Switching**: Developers must remember multiple commands and workflows
3. **Inconsistent UX**: Different CLIs (Node.js, Bash) with varying argument patterns
4. **Manual Integration**: No automated workflow progression between stages
5. **Limited Observability**: No centralized logging or workflow state tracking
6. **Configuration Drift**: Environment variables scattered across multiple `.env` files

## Proposed CLI Architecture

### 🏗️ **Core Design Principles**

1. **Single Binary**: One Go executable for all workflow operations
2. **Workflow-Centric**: Commands organized by the 12-stage workflow
3. **Agent Integration**: Native AI agent orchestration with multiple LLM providers
4. **System Integration**: Built-in Jira, Confluence, Git, and CI/CD connectors
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works offline, enhances with external integrations
6. **Extensible Plugin System**: Custom agents and integrations via Go plugins
